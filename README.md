# NameInIndiaTeam
One can use this program to find out whether your name exists in the Indian Cricket Team. The inspiration to create this came from Internet posts claiming that our Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi's name is so special that it exists in Team India's World Cup 2019 team.

In case it's not clear, following is the output of the program on giving "Narendra Modi" as input: 

 ```

            m O hammedshami
              D ineshkarthik
        jaspr I tbumrah
 ```      

Detailed Instructions to run the program:
```
1.Download the program "runme.cpp"
2.Compile it using "g++ runme.cpp -o run"
3.Execute it using "./run"

This program can ofcourse be tweaked to work for any list of names. Just change the string array "players" declared globally at the very beginning of the program.
